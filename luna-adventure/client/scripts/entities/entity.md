Entity System Overview
The entity system I've implemented follows object-oriented principles with four primary entity types that form the backbone of the game:

Player - Represents Luna the guinea pig, controlled by the player
Enemy - Represents various adversaries with different behaviors
Platform - Represents terrain and interactive surfaces
Collectible - Represents items that can be collected for points or effects

Each entity type has been designed to be:

Self-contained with all necessary state and behavior
Flexible to support different variations through type properties
Network-friendly with serialization methods
Physics-ready with collision detection

The Player Class
The Player class represents Luna, our guinea pig protagonist. It handles:

Movement physics: Storing velocity, grounded state, and direction
Game state: Tracking health, lives, score, and collectibles
Visual effects: Managing animations, visibility, and damage flashing
Power-up system: Supporting abilities like double jump and speed boost

The player can take damage, die and respawn, and collect power-ups that temporarily modify their abilities. The class also provides serialization for networking and proper collision detection.
The Enemy Class
The Enemy class defines adversaries with varying behaviors:

Enemy types: Supporting 'basic', 'flying', 'shooter', and 'boss' enemies
AI behaviors: Patrolling, chasing, attacking based on enemy type
Combat properties: Damage output, health, attack cooldowns
Detection systems: Awareness of player proximity and aggressive state changes

Enemies have sophisticated behaviors that change based on player distance. For example, flying enemies chase the player with a sine-wave pattern, while shooter enemies maintain distance and attack from afar.
The Platform Class
The Platform class creates the terrain and interactive surfaces:

Platform types: Supporting 'ground', 'platform', 'moving', 'breaking', and 'bouncy' platforms
Interactive behaviors: Platforms that move, break when stood on, or bounce the player
Visual styling: Different appearance based on platform type
Physics properties: Collision detection and player interaction adjustments

The platform system is particularly flexible, allowing for dynamic level design with platforms that transform the gameplay experience. Moving platforms carry the player along, breaking platforms collapse after being stood on, and bouncy platforms propel the player higher.
The Collectible Class
The Collectible class handles items players can gather:

Collectible types: 'carrot', 'goldenCarrot', 'powerup', 'coin', 'key', and 'gem'
Value system: Different point values based on rarity
Visual effects: Animations, bobbing, and sparkle effects
Special behaviors: Power-ups that grant abilities, keys that unlock areas

Collectibles create the reward system in the game, encouraging exploration and adding strategic elements with power-ups that change player capabilities.
Integration Through index.js
The index.js file provides a clean way to import all entities from a single source, making the codebase more maintainable and reducing import complexity throughout the project.
How These Entities Work Together
In the game loop we implemented earlier, these entities interact through:

Collision detection: The physics system checks for intersections between entities
Event handling: When entities collide, appropriate events fire (e.g., collecting items, taking damage)
State updates: Each entity updates its state based on time and interactions
Rendering: The SVG renderer displays each entity based on its current state

This entity system provides a solid foundation for Luna's Adventure, enabling the core gameplay mechanics while remaining extensible for future enhancements. The separation of concerns between entities keeps the code organized and allows for easy additions of new enemy types, platform behaviors, or collectible effects.
